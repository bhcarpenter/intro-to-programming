/* Part 2: Canvas Business Card
 *
 * For this assignment you will learn about the html5 canvas element by
 * designing a business card template for your very own interactive agency.
 * Your template will essentially be a function that draws a business card when
 * given some parameters (name, email, address, phone number, title, etc...).
 *
 * By drawing the card using a function that takes in parameters you can easily
 * create a card for your next hire by simply entering their information.
 *
 * Follow this tutorial to learn how to use Canvas: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Canvas_tutorial
 *
 * Once you have followed the tutorial take a look at the HTML file for this
 * assignment. You'll notice that I set up three canvases for you with the ids
 * "card1", "card2", and "card3".  Feel free to change the dimensions of the
 * canvases if you'd like.
 *
 * Your business card function will take the following parameters:
 *  - a canvasID, like "card1", this will be used in to the function to get
 *    the canvas element like so: var canvas = document.getElementById(cavasID);
 *  - name
 *  - title
 *  - address
 *  - work number
 *  - mobile number
 *  - email address
 * etc..
 *
 * Your business card should meet the following criteria:
 *  - Display all of the parameters from above on the card (except canvasID
 *    of course).
 *  - Use several colors
 *  - Have an aspect drawn using one or more for or while loops
 *  - Use as many of the canvas functions as you can
 *  - not use the drawImage() function
 *
 * During the next class everyone will be given a few minutes to show off their
 * business card and explain what techniques they used to create it. The top
 * business cards as decided by the class will get extra credit. I will also
 * choose 1 business card based on technique and/or code that will receive
 * extra credit.
 *
 * I will also give some extra credit if you use a subfunction within
 * your template function to draw part of the card.
