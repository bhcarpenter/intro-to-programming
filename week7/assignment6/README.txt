A quick description of tic-tac-toe for the uninitiated:
-------------------------------------------------------

- The game has two players.

- The first player gets to pick any spot on the game board and "claim" it for
themself, marking it with an "X".

- The second player gets to pick any of the remaining spots, and marks it with
an "O".

- A player wins if they manage to get three of their letter in a row, either
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
