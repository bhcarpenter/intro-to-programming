/* Part 1: Tip Calculator
 * For this assignment you're going to build a website "frontend" for the tip
 * calculator that you wrote in Assignment #3. If your tip calculator/splitter
 * from Assignment #3 doesn't work, you may use the posted solution instead.
 *
 * Here's what I want you to do:
 * 1. Add an event listener to the "submit" event of the tipCalculator form on
 *    the page.
 * 2. In your event listener:
 *    - Call the preventDefault() method of the event object so that the form
 *      doesn't reload the web page.
 *    - Get the value of the billAmount text field
 *    - Get the value of the percentageToTip text field
 *    - Get the value of the numberOfPeople text field
 *    - Convert all the values into number, and run them through your tip
 *      calculator/splitter
 *    - Display the result in the amountEachPersonShouldPay <div>
 * 3. Make the page look better. Feel free to edit the CSS and HTML.
 *
 * You may not use jQuery for this part. Here are the DOM functions that I
 * think you may need:
 *
 * document.addEventListener()
 * document.getElementById()
 * document.createTextNode()
 * someElement.appendChild()
 * someEvent.preventDefault()
 *
 * Note: The current value entered by a user into a text field is available as
 * the "value" property of the corresponding DOM element.

// TODO: Paste your tip calculator functions from Assignment #3 here.

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {

    // Put all of your code that attaches event handlers to DOM elements inside
    // of this function. It will be executed when the DOM is ready
    // to be messed with.
    // Note: This doesn't work in old versions of IE, so test your homework in
    // Firefox, Safari, or Chrome.


    // TODO: Your code goes here.
