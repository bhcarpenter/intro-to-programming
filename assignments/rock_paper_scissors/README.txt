Rock, Paper, Scissors!
======================

For this assignment you're going to work through some of the function exercises at Codecademy.com

Step 1: Function Review (optional)
-----------------------
Work through the "Introduction to Functions in JS" lesson at Codecademy: http://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-beginner-en-6LzGd

Make sure you do all 3 parts:
1. Meet the Functions
2. Functions and Return
3. Functions and Variables

You don't have to turn anything in for this part, but it will help you tremendously as you complete the rest of the assignments.

Step 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors
-----------------------------
Do the "Build 'Rock, Paper, Scissors'" assignment at Codeacademy: http://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-beginner-en-Bthev-mskY8

Make sure you do both parts:
1. Paper Beats Rock
2. Compare Function

The last step of the "Compare Function" section is called "Next Steps". You don't have to implement any of their suggestions, but if you want to add (up to 2) extra features to your game I'll give extra credit.

** Once you've finished your game on Codeacademy, copy and paste your JavaScript into the rock_paper_scissors.js file in this folder. **
