/*
Problem #1
----------
Convert the value in variable 'x' into a number, add 10 to it, and then
display it in the console.
*/
console.log("------ PROBLEM 1 ------\n");
var x = '100';

/*
Problem #2
----------
Write some JavaScript code to take the variables defined below and concatenate
them with strings that contain HTML tags to create a string of HTML that you
might right to display this information on the page.

Later in this class we'll do something like this, but we'll actually inject
the HTML into the webpage instead of just logging it to the console.

When you're done, you should see something like this in the console:
<article>
  <h1>Johnny Coder</h1>
  <dl>
    <dt>Name</dt> <dd>Johnny Coder</dd>
    <dt>Company</dt> <dd>Software Engineer</dd>
    <dt>Email</dt> <dd>johnny@abccorp.com</dd>
    <dt>Phone</dt> <dd>555-555-5555</dd>
  </dl>
</article>
*/
console.log("------ PROBLEM 2 ------\n");
var name = 'Johnny Coder';
var title = 'Software Engineer';
var company = 'ABC Corp';
var emailAddress = 'johnny@abccorp.com';
var phoneNumber = '555-555-5555';

/*
Problem #3
----------
One great use of if statements is checking to see if two variables contain
the same value.

Use the prompt() function to ask the user to enter a password. Then use an if
statement to compare their respons to the `secret` variable below.

If the user enters the same thing as the string stored in the `secret` variable,
display "Access granted." in the console. Otherwise display "Access denied."
*/
console.log("------ PROBLEM 3 ------\n");

var secret = 'abracadabra';
// TODO: Your code goes here!



/*
Problem #4
----------
Use prompt() to ask the user for their age.

Convert their age to a number (remember prompt() always gives you a string!) and
then check to see if they are older than 18. If they are, log "Old enough to
vote" to the console.

console.log("------ PROBLEM 4 ------\n");

 * Looping
 * ************************************** */

/*
Problem #5
----------
Ask the user for their password again, but instead of just checking to see if
it's equal to the value secret once (using an if statement), use a while 
statement to keep asking them for a password until they enter the correct one.
*/
console.log("------ PROBLEM 5 ------\n");

var secret = 'abracadabra';
// TODO: Your code goes here!



/*
Problem #6
----------
Use a for loop to log every number between 0 and `stop` to the console.

Extra Credit: Put them all on 1 line instead of separate lines (hint: string
concatenation).
*/
var stop = 11;
console.log("------ PROBLEM 6 ------\n");



/*
Problem #7
----------
Ask the user for a number, convert their response to a number, then write a for
loop that logs every number between that number and 0 to the console.

Then log "blast off!"
*/
console.log("------ PROBLEM 7 ------\n");
