    <h1>Variables and Operators</h1>

    <!--
    YOUR MISSION, should you choose to accept it, is to manipulate numbers
    and strings with JavaScript.
    -->

    <!--
    There are a couple of different ways of adding JavaScript to your web
    pages. One way is to put your code directly in a <script> tag like this:
    -->
    <script>

      // Inside the <script> tag we can write JavaScript code, including
      // JavaScript-style comments like this one.

      // Go ahead and turn the next line into a comment by adding // at
      // the beginning of the line. Otherwise this alert will annoy you 
      // every time you refresh the page.
      alert('Psst! Check the source.');

    </script>



    <!--
    Another way is to use a <script> tag that links to an external file. Just
    like putting your CSS in a separate file, this helps keep things
    organized better.
