/*
Problem #1: Review
------------------
Create three "people" objects that are just like your "me" object from
Problem 6 of Assignment 2. Assign them each to a different variable. You're
going to use these objects for Part B.

/*
Problem #2: Branching
---------------------
Write an if statement that logs "nom nom nom" to the console if numOfCookies is
greater than numCookiesNeeded, and "aw, sad" to the console if it isn't.

It should work no matter what numbers are actually in numOfCookies and
numCookiesNeeded.

/*
Problem #3: Looping
-------------------
Use a while loop to log every integer from 0 to 10 to the console. I created
a "counter" variable to get you started.
*/

var counter = 0;

/*
Problem #4: Functions
---------------------
Write a function called helloWorld that logs the string "hello, world" to
the console. Invoke it 4 times.

Extra credit if you use a loop to invoke it 4 times.

// TODO: Your code goes here!


/*
Problem #5: Functions
---------------------
Write a function called "emailSignature" that takes in 1 parameter called
"person". The "person" parameter will be an object with the same properties
as the objects from Problem #1.

emailSignature should create a string that looks like an email signature 
containing the parameter object's name, title, company, and phoneNumber 
properties. It should log this string to the console.

Invoke the emailSignature three times, once with each of the objects that you
created in Problem #1. You should see an email signature string for each person
in the console.
