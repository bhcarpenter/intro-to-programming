Shopping Cart
=============
This assignment is going to demonstrate how functions can interact with web
pages. I wrote all of the code that "glues" your functions to the web page,
so all you have to do is write the functions.

You'll learn how to make your functions work with webpages in a week or two.

Follow the instructions in shopping_cart.js!
