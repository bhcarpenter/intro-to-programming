# Object-Oriented Programming

At the core, OOP is just a way of organizing code.

The idea is to separate responsibilities of a program into individual components, which can be tested against individually, and define relationships between them to collaborate and get things done.

When it makes sense, people tend to create object types that correspond to real-world objects. The reasoning for this is that real-world objects automatically have constrained roles and responsibilities, and generally have a natural inheirtance structure as well.

# Object-Oriented Programming

When people talk about OOP, they generally refer to the following topics:

* Inheritance
* Encapsulation

And to a lesser extent, these topics as well:

* Abstraction
* Polymorphism
* Method overriding

And these topics, which don't really exist in Javascript:

* Method overloading
* Message passing
* Object collaboration
* Class/Instance

We don't have time to get into, but I'm listing them here for you to research after you're through with this class. Understanding these topics will help you communicate better with backend developers, and may even help you get a job.
